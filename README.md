# Personal Portfolio

This serves as a personal portfolio to showcase my background and work in IT. It is designed for both potential clients and employers to gain a clear understanding of who I am and the value I bring to a project or team. The design is straightforward and functional, without unnecessary complexity. The site includes four main pages: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. Each page provides concise and relevant information, with the Projects page receiving the most focus to highlight my previous work and accomplishments.

## üöÄ Features

- Home, About, Projects, and Contact pages
- Fully responsive design
- Modal-based documentation for detailed project insights
- Links to external user/project pages

## üõ† Technologies Used 

- **Vite** ‚Äì Fast build tool for efficient development
- **React** ‚Äì Component-based frontend framework
- **TypeScript** ‚Äì Ensures type safety and better code quality
- **MUI** ‚Äì Prebuilt UI components for consistent design

## üé® Design Approach

The site was built with a mobile-first approach to ensure responsiveness across all devices, particularly mobile, which is the most commonly used today. The overall layout is minimalist and user-friendly, aimed at delivering essential information quickly. For those interested in exploring more, each project includes links to deeper documentation or live versions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges in this project was deploying a React application to GitHub Pages, which only supports static content. React apps typically rely on browser-based routing, which can break when refreshing or directly accessing routes on GitHub Pages.

To solve this, I used the ``gh-pages`` package, which simplifies the deployment process by pushing the production-ready build to a separate branch configured for GitHub Pages. Additionally, I implemented hash-based routing (``HashRouter`` from ``react-router-dom``) instead of browser-based routing to ensure that all routes function correctly in the static environment.

Another challenge was that GitHub Pages does not provide the ability to use environment files to store sensitive information like a Personal Access Token (PAT) for granting access to private repositories. A simple solution to this was to create a public repository that contains all the relevant documentation for each project that will be displayed on the website.
