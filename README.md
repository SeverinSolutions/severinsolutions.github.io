# SeverinSolutions Homepage (UNDER DEVELOPMENT!)

This repository contains the codebase for the SeverinSolutions homepage. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my work and provide essential information for potential clients and customers about who I am and the services I offer.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following key technologies:

* **Vite:** Employed as a fast and efficient build tool and development server. Vite's speed allows for rapid iteration and a smooth development experience.
* **React:** Chosen as the front-end JavaScript library for building a dynamic and interactive user interface. React's component-based architecture promotes code reusability and maintainability.
* **TypeScript:** Integrated as a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. TypeScript enhances code quality, improves developer productivity through better tooling and early error detection, and makes the codebase more robust.
* **MUI (Material-UI):** Utilized as a comprehensive library of React UI components following Google's Material Design guidelines. MUI provides a consistent and visually appealing design system, accelerating the development of the user interface.
